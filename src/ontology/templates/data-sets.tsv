OBI:0003327	image data set			A data set that is comprised of multidimensional structured measurements and metadata required for a morphological representation of an entity. An image data set can be the source from which an image (such as a 2D image using pixels or a 3D image using voxels) is produced.		The output produced by a digital imaging technique, such as microscopy, MRI, or CT.	https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9625-1899 ""William D. Duncan"",https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-3450 ""Lauren M.
