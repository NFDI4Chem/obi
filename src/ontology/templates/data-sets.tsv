OBI:0003327	imaging data set			A data set that is comprised of structured measurements about some entity and its associated metadata using pixels (2D), voxels (3D), or an arbitrary number of dimensions. An image data set can be the source from which an image is produced.		The output produced by a digital imaging technique, such as microscopy, MRI, or CT.	https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9625-1899 ""William D. Duncan"",https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-3450 ""Lauren M.
